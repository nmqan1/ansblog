Despite the Information System (IS) was still in its infancy stage, the company had not invested further resource to renovate it. The system ran into serveral problems including (1) not catching up with needs from various functions, (2) bulky and static back-end data that needs updating seminannually, (3) not aligning with company's overall business strategy, (4) not user-friendly, thus low level of self-servicing, (5) lack of compatibility with other HRIS modules. I was in main charge of the company's performance management system and I saw the latent issues when starting a new cycle without making changes to the system. Thus, I initiate the project to renovate the IS in coordiation with other stakeholders and end-users."
