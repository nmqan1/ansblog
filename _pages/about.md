Greetings to all!

I'm An, pronounced as /æn/. I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and now reside in Madiscon, Wisconsin for my MBA in Strategic Human Resource Management.

During my years working in HR, I have always wondered how to collect evidence and use it to address HR problems. It turns out that many topics I learned at Graduate School can help me do so. So in this blog, I will dedicate a large part to talk about what techniques or data tools HR professionals might find useful to improve their decisions. The applications may be applied to various díciplines such as Recruitment, Compensation, Training and Development, Workforce Planning, Employee Engagement, ect. The rest of the blog is about random just-for-fun things in my life.

I hope this could be helpful to read!
