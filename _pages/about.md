Greetings to all!

I'm An, pronounced as /Ã¦n/. I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and now reside in Madiscon, Wisconsin for my MBA. I concentrate in Strategic Human Resouce Management as I developed my interest in the field through the past few years.

As an HR professional, I have always wondered how to collect evidence and use it to support recommendations for HR problems. It turns out that many topics I learned at Graduate School can help me do so. So in this blog, I will dedicate a large part to talk about what techniques or data tools HR professional might use to improve their decisions. The rest of the blog is about random just-for-fun things in my life.

I hope this could be helpful to read!
