Greetings to all!

I'm An, orignally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I now reside in Madiscon, Wisconsin to pursue my MBA in Strategic Human Resource Management at University of Wisconsin - Madison.

During my years working in HR, I have always wondered how to collect evidence and use it to address HR problems. It turns out that many topics I learned at Graduate School can help me do so. So in this blog, I will dedicate a large part to talk about what techniques or data tools HR professionals might find useful to improve their decisions. The applications may be used in various HR disciplines such as Recruitment, Compensation, Training and Development, Workforce Planning, Employee Engagement, ect. The rest of the blog is about random just-for-fun things in my life.

I hope this could be helpful to read!
