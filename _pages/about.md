This page is dedicated to the little findings I come across when I am in Grad school. Believing certain HR decisions can be improved through statistical evidence and comprehensive analysis, I will try to relate some issues HR practitioners facing with some analysis tactics.
Hopefully, I can bring joy and helpful tips for my readers.
